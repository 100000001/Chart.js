About this branch
=================

This branch provides documentation for the Chart.js project. It is set up to
provide the hosting for <http://www.chartjs.org/>

Running and building locally
============================

The documentation is written using Markdown and Jekyll. See GitHub's Jekyll
documentation at <https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/> and
see GitHub's `pages-gem` at <https://github.com/github/pages-gem> regarding how
to set up the identical build environment locally.

Syncing
=======

The contents of the `master` branch's `docs` directory should be copied to this
`gh-pages` branch's `_doc-parts` directory. Please submit a pull request to do
this whenever updating the `master` branch, unless the `master `branch is
preparing to make an alpha release.
